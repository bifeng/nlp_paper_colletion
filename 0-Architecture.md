### Relation Extraction

+ Entity-Relation Extraction as Multi-Turn Question Answering, Xiaoya Li, Fan Yin, Zijun Sun, Xiayu Li, Arianna Yuan, Duo Chai, Mingxin Zhou, Jiwei Li, ACL 2019, [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05529v1) 

  we propose a new paradigm for the task of entity-relation extraction. We cast the task as a multi-turn question answering problem, i.e., the extraction of entities and relations is transformed to the task of identifying answer spans from the context.
