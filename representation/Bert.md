### datasets

[multilingual](https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/multilingual.md) Chinese

The entire Wikipedia dump for each language (excluding user and talk pages) was taken as the training data for each language.

we performed <u>exponentially smoothed weighting</u> of the data during pre-training data creation (and WordPiece vocab creation). So, high-resource languages like English will be under-sampled, and low-resource languages like Icelandic will be over-sampled.



### question

- Why the strategy for mismatch problem is useful?

  

- How many number of parameters in transformer?

  

- How many sample is enough for transfer learning?

  

- Did bert can achieve state of art in dependency parsing, semantic role labeling etc. area? why?

  

- What's WordPiece tokenization ?

- 

### excise

- bert for ranking
- bert for text generation
