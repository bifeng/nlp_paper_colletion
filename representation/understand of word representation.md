approach to pmi-based word embeddings. Transactions of the Association for Computational
Linguistics, 4:385–399, 2016.

Arora et al. (2016) propose a generative model (named RAND-WALK) of sentences, where every word is parameterized by a d-dimensional vector. With a key postulate that the word vectors are angularly uniform (“isotropic"), the family of PMI-based word representations can be explained under the RAND-WALK model in terms of the maximum likelihood rule.
