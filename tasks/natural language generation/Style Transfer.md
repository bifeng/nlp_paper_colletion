+ Mask and Infill: Applying Masked Language Model for Sentiment Transfer, Xing Wu, Tao Zhang, Liangjun Zang, Jizhong Han, Songlin Hu, IJCAI 2019 [paper](<https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/732>) | [code](<https://github.com/IIEKES/MLM_transfer>) 

  > From the view of Text Infilling or Cloze:
  >
  > we propose a two steps approach: Mask and Infill. In the mask step, we identify and mask the sentiment tokens of a given sentence. In the infill step, we utilize a pre-trained Masked Language Model (MLM) to infill the masked positions by predicting words or phrases conditioned on the context and target sentiment.
