## Semantic Parsing



+ Shallow Semantic Parsing of Chinese, HLT-NAACL, 2004, Sun, Honglinï¼ŒJurafsky, Daniel [paper](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N04-1032) 



### CCG Semantic Parsing

+ Complex discrete learning algorithms

+ But, grammars hopefully generalize to unseen data well!

+ Difficult to engineer: few people can do it and it takes a lot of time

### Neural Semantic Parsing

+ Treat meaning as a string...
+ Apply NMT
+ Close to SOTA performance!!!
+ Much easier to build (with toolkits)

#### Constrained Decoding

##### Token-based Decoding
The output space is tokens, but they are constrained to be relevant at each time step.

##### Grammar-based Decoding

The output space is production rules, and a grammar defines the constraints.
